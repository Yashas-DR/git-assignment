Introduction to Git and GitHub
What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, maintaining a full history of every modification made to the project files.

Some key features of Git include:

Branching and Merging: Developers can create separate branches for different features, experiment without affecting the main codebase, and later merge changes back.
Version Tracking: Git tracks every change to the code, providing a detailed history of what was changed, by whom, and when.
Distributed Architecture: Each developer has a full copy of the repository on their local machine, ensuring no single point of failure.
What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories. It provides a web-based interface for collaborating on code, offering tools for version control, issue tracking, and continuous integration.

With GitHub, you can:

Host Repositories: Store your Git projects online, making it easier to share and collaborate with others.
Collaborate: Work with teams across the world, contribute to open-source projects, and use pull requests to suggest changes.
Manage Projects: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and bugs, and GitHub Actions to automate workflows.
Showcase Your Work: GitHub allows you to showcase your projects and contributions to the open-source community.
Basic Git Commands
Here are some essential Git commands:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git clone [URL]: Clones a repository from GitHub to your local machine.
git add [file]: Stages changes (new, modified, or deleted files) for the next commit.
git commit -m "message": Commits staged changes with a message describing the changes.
git push: Pushes committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository (like GitHub).
git pull: Fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote repository.
git branch: Lists branches or creates a new branch.
git checkout [branch]: Switches to a different branch.
git merge [branch]: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
